Q: What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A: A merge will update changes in the local repo to the working directory, however this can result in merge conflicts if the working directory has changed since the beginning of the branch. A rebase will update the start of a branch to a later commit, helping to resolve merge conflicts.
